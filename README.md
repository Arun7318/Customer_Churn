# Objective
Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry. I have the ‘Telco Churn’ data, it contains the information about each customer of this telco company along with whether if a given customer has chunred or not.

I wanted to understand what makes customers churn or not, and also wanted to know what we could do to prevent the churn.
